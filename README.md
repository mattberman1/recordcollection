cd vinyl-catalog
```

2. Install dependencies:

```

3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Go to Settings → API and copy your project URL and anon key

4. Set up the database:

CREATE TABLE albums (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  artist TEXT NOT NULL,
  release_year INTEGER,
  album_art_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Create an index for faster searches
CREATE INDEX idx_albums_title_artist ON albums(title, artist);

-- Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
ALTER TABLE albums ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create a policy that allows all operations
CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations" ON albums FOR ALL USING (true);
```
